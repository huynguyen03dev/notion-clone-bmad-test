## Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH Priority:**
- Add detailed user flow diagrams for core kanban workflows
- Specify user feedback collection mechanisms for MVP validation
- Define security testing requirements more specifically

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- Conduct user interviews to validate assumptions
- Create formal stakeholder approval process
- Add more specific error handling scenarios

**LOW Priority:**
- Enhance competitive analysis with more tools
- Add more detailed accessibility testing requirements

## MVP Scope Assessment
- **Scope is Appropriate:** Core kanban functionality with real-time collaboration
- **No Features to Cut:** All included features are essential for competitive kanban tool
- **No Missing Essentials:** All core kanban requirements covered
- **Timeline Realistic:** 8-12 weeks achievable with defined scope

## Technical Readiness
- **Architecture Constraints Clear:** Next.js, PostgreSQL, Docker well-defined
- **Technical Risks Identified:** Real-time collaboration complexity noted
- **Ready for Architect:** Sufficient technical guidance provided

## Recommendations

**Before Architecture Phase:**
1. Create detailed user flow diagrams for primary workflows
2. Define specific MVP feedback collection approach
3. Enhance security requirements with testing specifics

**For Next Phase:**
1. UX Expert should focus on detailed user flows and wireframes
2. Architect should prioritize real-time collaboration technical design
3. Consider user research validation during development

## Final Decision: âœ… READY FOR ARCHITECT

The PRD is comprehensive, properly structured, and provides sufficient detail for the architect to proceed. The identified gaps are minor and don't block architectural design work.
