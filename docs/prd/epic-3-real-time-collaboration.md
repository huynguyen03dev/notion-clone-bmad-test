# Epic 3: Real-time Collaboration

**Epic Goal:** Transform the application from a single-user tool to a collaborative platform by implementing real-time synchronization, board sharing, and multi-user editing capabilities. This epic delivers the key differentiator that enables team collaboration.

## Story 3.1: Real-time Infrastructure
As a developer,
I want robust real-time communication infrastructure,
so that multiple users can collaborate seamlessly on shared boards.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WebSocket server implementation for real-time communication
2. Connection management with automatic reconnection logic
3. User presence indicators showing who's currently viewing the board
4. Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
5. Message queuing for offline users
6. Performance optimization for large boards with many users
7. Error handling for connection failures
8. Real-time connection health monitoring

## Story 3.2: Board Sharing and Permissions
As a user,
I want to share my boards with team members,
so that we can collaborate on projects together.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. "Share Board" functionality with email invitation system
2. Board access levels (view-only, editor, admin)
3. User management interface for shared boards
4. Remove user access functionality
5. Board ownership transfer capabilities
6. Public board sharing with read-only access
7. Share link generation with expiration options
8. Email notifications for board invitations

## Story 3.3: Live Synchronization
As a user,
I want to see changes made by other users in real-time,
so that I can stay updated on project progress and avoid conflicts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Real-time task creation, editing, and deletion synchronization
2. Live drag-and-drop updates across all connected users
3. Column changes synchronized immediately
4. User cursors and selection indicators
5. Optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution
6. Change attribution showing who made each modification
7. Activity feed showing recent board changes
8. Graceful handling of network interruptions

## Story 3.4: Collaborative Editing
As a user,
I want to edit tasks collaboratively with my team members,
so that we can work together efficiently without conflicts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Simultaneous task editing with operational transformation
2. Real-time typing indicators in task detail modals
3. Edit conflict resolution with user notification
4. Lock mechanism for critical operations
5. Change history and version tracking
6. Collaborative cursor positioning in text fields
7. Auto-save with conflict detection
8. Merge conflict resolution interface
