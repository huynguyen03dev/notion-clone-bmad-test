# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable teams to visualize workflow and manage tasks through intuitive kanban boards
- Deliver lightning-fast performance with <2 second load times and <500ms interactions
- Provide real-time collaboration capabilities for distributed teams
- Create a clean, accessible UI that reduces cognitive overhead compared to complex tools
- Support self-hosting deployment for teams wanting data control
- Achieve 70% user adoption rate (users creating 3+ tasks in first session)
- Maintain 60% weekly active user retention after 4 weeks

## Background Context

Teams and individuals are caught between overly complex enterprise project management tools and overly simplistic to-do applications. Current solutions suffer from poor performance, cluttered interfaces, and lack of real-time collaboration features, leading to decreased productivity and teams reverting to inefficient methods like spreadsheets. The rise of remote work has increased demand for visual project management tools, while modern web technologies now enable building fast, responsive applications that can compete with desktop alternatives.

This PRD defines requirements for a lightweight kanban board application that focuses on core workflow visualization without feature bloat, targeting small development teams (3-10 members) and individual professionals who need better project organization and team coordination.
