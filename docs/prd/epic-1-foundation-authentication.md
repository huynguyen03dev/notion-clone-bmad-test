# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication

**Epic Goal:** Establish a deployable application foundation with user authentication, project infrastructure, and basic navigation shell. This epic delivers a working application that users can access, sign up for, and navigate, providing the essential infrastructure for all subsequent functionality.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment
As a developer,
I want a properly configured Next.js project with all necessary dependencies,
so that I can begin development with a consistent, reproducible environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Next.js 14+ project initialized with App Router configuration
2. TypeScript configuration with strict mode enabled
3. TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui components properly installed and configured
4. Prisma ORM configured with PostgreSQL connection
5. Docker Compose file created for local PostgreSQL database
6. pnpm package manager configured with workspace settings
7. ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality
8. Basic folder structure established (app/, components/, lib/, etc.)

## Story 1.2: Database Schema and Connection
As a developer,
I want a properly designed database schema with reliable connections,
so that user and application data can be stored and retrieved efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Prisma schema defined for User, Board, Column, and Task entities
2. Database migrations created and tested
3. Connection pooling configured for production scalability
4. Database seeding script created for development data
5. Environment variables properly configured for database connection
6. Database connection health check endpoint implemented
7. Error handling implemented for database connection failures

## Story 1.3: User Authentication System
As a user,
I want to create an account and log in securely,
so that I can access my personal kanban boards and data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. User registration form with email and password validation
2. Secure login form with proper error handling
3. Password hashing implemented using industry standards
4. JWT token generation and validation for session management
5. Protected route middleware for authenticated pages
6. Logout functionality that properly clears session data
7. Basic user profile management (view/edit email)
8. Password reset functionality via email

## Story 1.4: Application Shell and Navigation
As a user,
I want a clean, responsive application layout with intuitive navigation,
so that I can easily access different parts of the application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Responsive header with logo, navigation, and user menu
2. Mobile-friendly navigation with hamburger menu
3. Footer with basic application information
4. Loading states for page transitions
5. Error boundary components for graceful error handling
6. Dark/light theme toggle functionality
7. Breadcrumb navigation for deeper pages
8. Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
