# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing the full-stack Next.js application with clear separation between frontend components, API routes, database schemas, and configuration files. This approach simplifies development workflow and deployment while maintaining code organization.

## Service Architecture
**Monolithic Next.js Application with API Routes:** Full-stack application using Next.js 14+ App Router with integrated API routes for backend functionality. This architecture provides:
- Simplified deployment and development setup
- Excellent performance through server-side rendering and static generation
- Built-in API layer without additional service complexity
- Easy real-time features through WebSocket integration

## Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests:** Component testing with React Testing Library and Jest
- **Integration Tests:** API route testing and database integration tests
- **E2E Tests:** Critical user flows using Playwright or Cypress
- **Manual Testing:** Convenience methods for local development and staging validation
- **Real-time Testing:** WebSocket connection and synchronization testing

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Technology Stack:**
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ with App Router for optimal performance and developer experience
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS for utility-first styling with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management:** React Server Components with minimal client-side state (Zustand for complex state if needed)
- **Real-time:** WebSocket implementation for live collaboration features
- **TypeScript:** Full TypeScript implementation for type safety and developer productivity

**Backend & Database:**
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js or similar for secure user management
- **API Design:** RESTful API routes with OpenAPI documentation
- **File Storage:** Local filesystem for MVP (cloud storage in Phase 2)

**Development & Deployment:**
- **Package Manager:** pnpm for efficient dependency management
- **Development Environment:** Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL and consistent development setup
- **Deployment:** Containerized deployment with Docker for easy self-hosting
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment pipeline
- **Environment Management:** Environment-specific configuration with validation

**Performance & Monitoring:**
- **Caching:** Next.js built-in caching with Redis for session storage if needed
- **Monitoring:** Basic application monitoring and error tracking (Sentry or similar)
- **Performance:** Bundle analysis and Core Web Vitals monitoring
- **Database:** Connection pooling and query optimization for scalability
