# Kanban Board Application UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the Kanban Board Application's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

The application targets small development teams (3-10 members) and individual professionals who need efficient project organization without the complexity of enterprise tools or the limitations of basic to-do applications.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

**Primary: Small Development Team Members**
- Technical professionals working on multiple concurrent projects
- Need fast, efficient task management without context switching
- Value real-time collaboration and immediate feedback
- Expect keyboard shortcuts and power-user features
- Prefer clean, minimal interfaces over feature-heavy dashboards

**Secondary: Individual Professionals & Freelancers**
- Freelancers, consultants managing multiple client projects
- Need visual project overview and professional presentation
- Value simplicity and ease of use over advanced features
- Often work across different devices and locations
- Require reliable, accessible tools for client communication

#### Usability Goals

1. **Immediate Productivity:** New users can create their first board and add tasks within 2 minutes
2. **Efficient Workflow:** Power users can manage tasks using keyboard shortcuts and drag-and-drop without mouse dependency
3. **Real-time Confidence:** All users see changes immediately with clear visual feedback for collaboration
4. **Cross-device Consistency:** Users can seamlessly switch between desktop and mobile without losing functionality
5. **Cognitive Load Reduction:** Interface prioritizes essential information, hiding complexity until needed

#### Design Principles

1. **Speed Above All** - Every interaction must feel instantaneous; optimize for performance over visual flourishes
2. **Clarity Through Simplicity** - Use whitespace, clear typography, and minimal UI elements to reduce cognitive overhead
3. **Real-time Transparency** - Make collaboration visible through presence indicators, live updates, and change attribution
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality works everywhere; advanced features enhance the experience
5. **Accessible by Design** - Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and high contrast built-in from day one

    style F fill:#fce4ec
```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:**
- **Desktop:** Top navigation bar with logo, board switcher, search, user menu, and real-time collaboration indicators
- **Mobile:** Bottom tab bar with Dashboard, Current Board, Search, and Profile tabs
- **Breadcrumbs:** Dashboard > Board Name > (Task Name when modal open)

**Secondary Navigation:**
- **Board-level:** Floating action buttons for common actions (Add Task, Board Settings, Share)
- **Context menus:** Right-click/long-press menus for task and column actions
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** Accessible via '?' key for help overlay

**Breadcrumb Strategy:**
- Always show current location: Dashboard > Board Name
- Include board switching without returning to dashboard
- Show task context when detail modal is open
- Maintain navigation state during real-time collaboration

## User Flows

### Flow 1: First-Time User Onboarding

**User Goal:** New user creates account and first kanban board
**Entry Points:** Landing page, signup link, invitation email
**Success Criteria:** User has created account, first board, and added at least one task

**Flow Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Landing Page] --> B{Has Account?}
    B -->|No| C[Sign Up Form]
    B -->|Yes| D[Login Form]
    
    C --> E[Email Verification]
    E --> F[Welcome Dashboard]
    D --> F
    
    F --> G[Create First Board Modal]
    G --> H[Board Template Selection]
    H --> I[Board Name & Columns]
    I --> J[New Board View]
    
    J --> K[Add First Task Prompt]
    K --> L[Task Creation Modal]
    L --> M[Task Added Successfully]
    M --> N[Onboarding Complete]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style N fill:#e8f5e8
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Email already exists → Show login option with "forgot password" link
- Email verification fails → Resend verification with clear instructions
- Board creation fails → Show error message, allow retry with saved data
- Network interruption → Save draft locally, sync when reconnected

### Flow 2: Daily Task Management

**User Goal:** User manages tasks on existing board throughout workday
**Entry Points:** Dashboard, direct board URL, mobile app
**Success Criteria:** User can quickly add, edit, move, and complete tasks

**Flow Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Dashboard] --> B[Select Board]
    B --> C[Board View Loads]
    
    C --> D{User Action}
    D -->|Add Task| E[Quick Add in Column]
    D -->|Edit Task| F[Click Task Card]
    D -->|Move Task| G[Drag & Drop]
    D -->|Search| H[Search Panel]
    
    E --> E1[Task Created]
    E1 --> C
    
    F --> F1[Task Detail Modal]
    F1 --> F2[Edit Fields]
    F2 --> F3[Save Changes]
    F3 --> C
    
    G --> G1[Visual Feedback]
    G1 --> G2[Drop in New Column]
    G2 --> G3[Position Updated]
    G3 --> C
    
    H --> H1[Filter Results]
    H1 --> H2[Select Task]
    H2 --> F1
    
    style C fill:#f3e5f5
    style E1 fill:#e8f5e8
    style G3 fill:#e8f5e8
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Drag operation fails → Revert to original position, show error toast
- Simultaneous edits → Show conflict resolution dialog
- Network disconnection → Queue changes locally, show offline indicator
- Task save fails → Preserve user input, retry automatically

### Flow 3: Real-time Collaboration

**User Goal:** Multiple team members collaborate on shared board simultaneously
**Entry Points:** Shared board invitation, direct board access
**Success Criteria:** Users see real-time updates and can collaborate without conflicts

**Flow Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Joins Board] --> B[WebSocket Connection]
    B --> C[Load Board State]
    C --> D[Show User Presence]
    
    D --> E{Collaboration Event}
    E -->|Other User Adds Task| F[Show New Task]
    E -->|Other User Moves Task| G[Animate Movement]
    E -->|Other User Edits| H[Show Edit Indicator]
    E -->|User Makes Change| I[Broadcast Update]
    
    F --> J[Update Board State]
    G --> J
    H --> K[Show Typing Indicator]
    K --> J
    
    I --> L[Optimistic Update]
    L --> M[Server Confirmation]
    M --> N{Conflict?}
    N -->|No| J
    N -->|Yes| O[Conflict Resolution]
    O --> J
    
    J --> E
    
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style J fill:#e8f5e8
    style O fill:#ffebee
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Connection lost → Show offline mode, queue changes for sync
- Conflict resolution → Show both versions, allow user to choose
- Too many simultaneous users → Implement graceful degradation
- Server overload → Show performance warning, suggest refresh
