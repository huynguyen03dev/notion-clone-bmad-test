# Kanban Board Application Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable teams to visualize workflow and manage tasks through intuitive kanban boards
- Deliver lightning-fast performance with <2 second load times and <500ms interactions
- Provide real-time collaboration capabilities for distributed teams
- Create a clean, accessible UI that reduces cognitive overhead compared to complex tools
- Support self-hosting deployment for teams wanting data control
- Achieve 70% user adoption rate (users creating 3+ tasks in first session)
- Maintain 60% weekly active user retention after 4 weeks

### Background Context

Teams and individuals are caught between overly complex enterprise project management tools and overly simplistic to-do applications. Current solutions suffer from poor performance, cluttered interfaces, and lack of real-time collaboration features, leading to decreased productivity and teams reverting to inefficient methods like spreadsheets. The rise of remote work has increased demand for visual project management tools, while modern web technologies now enable building fast, responsive applications that can compete with desktop alternatives.

This PRD defines requirements for a lightweight kanban board application that focuses on core workflow visualization without feature bloat, targeting small development teams (3-10 members) and individual professionals who need better project organization and team coordination.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a clean, minimalist interface that prioritizes speed and clarity over feature density. The design should feel familiar to users of modern development tools while being approachable for non-technical users. Focus on reducing cognitive load through clear visual hierarchy, consistent interactions, and immediate feedback for all user actions.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Drag-and-Drop First:** Primary interaction model for task management with smooth, responsive animations
- **Keyboard-Friendly:** Full keyboard navigation support with intuitive shortcuts (Space to edit, Enter to save, Esc to cancel)
- **Real-time Feedback:** Immediate visual confirmation of all actions with optimistic UI updates
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show essential information by default, reveal details on demand
- **Touch-Optimized:** Gesture-friendly design for mobile users with appropriate touch targets

### Core Screens and Views
- **Dashboard/Board List:** Overview of all user boards with quick access and creation
- **Kanban Board View:** Main workspace with columns and draggable task cards

- **Board Settings:** Column management and sharing configuration
- **User Authentication:** Clean login/signup flow with minimal friction

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Ensure full keyboard navigation, proper color contrast ratios, screen reader compatibility, and semantic HTML structure. All interactive elements must have appropriate ARIA labels and focus indicators.

### Branding
Modern, professional aesthetic using shadcn/ui design system with clean typography, subtle shadows, and smooth animations. Color palette should support both light and dark themes with excellent contrast ratios. Emphasize whitespace and clear visual hierarchy over decorative elements.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Mobile-first responsive design that works seamlessly across all device sizes. Optimized touch interactions for mobile/tablet while maintaining full functionality on desktop with mouse and keyboard.
