## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Vitest for unit and integration testing [Source: fullstack-architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Accessibility Testing**: axe-core integration for WCAG AA compliance [Source: Story 1.4 Dev Agent Record]
- **Test File Locations**: Co-located with components in `__tests__` directories
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% code coverage for new components

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Board components, API routes, utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: Complete board management flow with authentication
- **Accessibility Tests**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, color contrast
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing with 100+ boards scenario
- **Responsive Tests**: Cross-breakpoint behavior validation

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Board CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete with proper error handling
2. **Authentication Integration**: Protected routes and session validation
3. **Search Functionality**: Debounced search with filtering and highlighting
4. **Modal Interactions**: Create/edit forms with validation and error states
5. **Empty States**: No boards scenario with proper call-to-action
6. **Performance Scenarios**: Large dataset handling and interaction responsiveness

## Project Structure Notes
All file paths align with Next.js App Router structure as defined in the fullstack architecture. Protected routes use the `(protected)` route group pattern established in Story 1.4.
