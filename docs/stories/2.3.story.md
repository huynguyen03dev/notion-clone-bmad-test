## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.2 (Column Management) completion:

- Established patterns for tRPC API structure and error handling
- Implemented optimistic UI updates with proper rollback mechanisms
- Used @dnd-kit library successfully for drag-and-drop interactions
- Achieved 100% test coverage with comprehensive error handling
- Followed TypeScript strict mode with proper interface definitions

### Data Models

**Task Model** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#data-models]:

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string
  title: string
  description?: string | null
  columnId: string
  boardId: string
  assigneeId?: string | null
  priority: TaskPriority // LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
  dueDate?: Date | null
  position: number
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}

enum TaskPriority {
  LOW = 'LOW',
  MEDIUM = 'MEDIUM',
  HIGH = 'HIGH',
}
```

**Database Schema** [Source: docs/database-schema.md#task]:

- Title: VARCHAR(200) with validation
- Description: TEXT (optional)
- Priority: Enum with default MEDIUM
- Strategic indexes on boardId, assigneeId, dueDate, priority
- Composite unique constraint on (columnId, position)
- Cascade delete when column/board is deleted

### API Specifications

**tRPC Task Router** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#api-specification]:

- `task.create` - Create new task with validation
- `task.update` - Update task fields with optimistic updates
- `task.delete` - Soft delete with confirmation
- `task.duplicate` - Create copy of existing task
- `task.getByBoard` - Fetch all tasks for a board
- All endpoints include authentication and authorization checks
- Input validation using Zod schemas with character limits

### Component Specifications

**TaskCard Component** [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#task-detail-modal]:

- Display: title, description preview, due date, priority indicator, assignee
- Hover states reveal task actions (edit, duplicate, delete)
- Click opens TaskDetailModal
- Drag-and-drop integration with @dnd-kit/sortable
- Responsive design with mobile touch targets (44px minimum)

**TaskDetailModal Component** [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#task-detail-modal]:

- Large title field with auto-resize
- Rich text description editor
- Due date picker with calendar widget
- Priority dropdown (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Assignment dropdown with user search
- Auto-save functionality with debouncing
- Real-time collaboration indicators
- Accessible form validation
- Modal can be resized/maximized

### File Locations

**Component Files** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#components]:

- `components/kanban/TaskCard.tsx` - Individual task display component
- `components/kanban/TaskDetailModal.tsx` - Task editing modal
- `components/kanban/TaskCreateButton.tsx` - Quick task creation
- `components/ui/` - shadcn/ui base components (Button, Modal, Form, etc.)

**API Files**:

- `pages/api/trpc/[trpc].ts` - tRPC API handler

- `server/api/schemas/task.ts` - Zod validation schemas

**Database Files**:

- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Task model definition
- `prisma/migrations/` - Database migration files

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#testing-strategy]:

- **Unit Tests**: React Testing Library for components, Vitest for utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Supertest for API endpoints with real database
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Validate <500ms interaction requirement
- **Accessibility Tests**: axe-core for WCAG AA compliance

**Test File Locations**:

- `__tests__/components/kanban/TaskCard.test.tsx`
- `__tests__/components/kanban/TaskDetailModal.test.tsx`
- `__tests__/api/task.test.ts`
- `e2e/task-management.spec.ts`

**Coverage Requirements**: 80%+ code coverage for all new components and API endpoints

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#performance-optimization]:

- <500ms interaction times for all task operations
- Optimistic UI updates with server reconciliation
- Component memoization for expensive renders
- Virtual scrolling for large task lists (>100 tasks)

**Real-time Features** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#real-time-architecture]:

- WebSocket integration for live task updates
- Presence tracking for collaborative editing
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Optimistic updates with rollback on failure

**Security Requirements** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#security]:

- Input validation with XSS prevention
- Role-based access control (VIEWER/EDITOR/ADMIN)
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Audit logging for task operations

### Project Structure Notes

All file paths align with the established Next.js 14+ App Router structure. Components follow the shadcn/ui pattern with proper TypeScript interfaces. API routes use tRPC for type-safe communication between frontend and backend.

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library for components, Supertest for API testing
**Location**: `__tests__/` directory with mirrored folder structure
**Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage required
**E2E**: Playwright tests in `e2e/` directory
**Performance**: Automated validation of <500ms interaction requirement
