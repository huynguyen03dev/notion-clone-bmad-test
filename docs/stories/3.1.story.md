```typescript
interface TaskMovedEvent {
  taskId: string
  sourceColumnId: string
  targetColumnId: string
  position: number
  user: User
  timestamp: Date
}

interface UserPresenceEvent {
  boardId: string
  user: User
  action: 'joined' | 'left'
  timestamp: Date
}

interface TaskUpdatedEvent {
  taskId: string
  changes: Partial<Task>
  user: User
  timestamp: Date
}
```

**Presence Tracking Model** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#real-time-architecture]:

```typescript
interface UserPresence {
  userId: string
  boardId: string
  socketId: string
  joinedAt: Date
  lastSeen: Date
  user: {
    id: string
    name: string
    email: string
    avatar?: string
  }
}
```

- <100ms latency for real-time updates
- Support for 50+ concurrent users per board
- Message batching to reduce WebSocket overhead
- Efficient presence tracking with Redis TTL
- Graceful degradation for high load scenarios

**Real-time Architecture** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#real-time-architecture]:

- Socket.IO with fallback support for older browsers
- Room-based message broadcasting for efficiency
- Operational transformation for conflict resolution
- Optimistic updates with server reconciliation
- Connection pooling and load balancing ready

**Security Requirements** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#security]:

- WebSocket authentication using NextAuth.js sessions
- Board-level permission verification for all events
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation for all WebSocket messages
- Audit logging for real-time events

### Project Structure Notes

All file paths align with the established Next.js 14+ App Router structure. WebSocket implementation follows Socket.IO best practices with proper TypeScript interfaces. Redis integration uses the existing cache infrastructure. Components follow the shadcn/ui pattern with proper accessibility support.

## Testing
