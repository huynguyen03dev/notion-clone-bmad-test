## Story

As a developer,
I want a properly configured Next.js project with all necessary dependencies,
so that I can begin development with a consistent, reproducible environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Next.js 14+ project initialized with App Router configuration
2. TypeScript configuration with strict mode enabled
3. TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui components properly installed and configured
4. Prisma ORM configured with PostgreSQL connection
5. Docker Compose file created for local PostgreSQL database
6. pnpm package manager configured with workspace settings
7. ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality
8. Basic folder structure established (app/, components/, lib/, etc.)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 14.1+ with App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.3+ with strict configuration
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui (latest) for accessible component system
- **CSS Framework:** TailwindCSS 3.4+ for utility-first styling
- **Database ORM:** Prisma 5.8+ for type-safe database access
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ for primary data storage
- **Package Manager:** pnpm 8.14+ for efficient dependency management
- **Build Tool:** Turborepo 1.11+ for monorepo build system
- **Testing:** Vitest 1.2+ with React Testing Library 14+
- **Code Quality:** ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting

**Starter Template Recommendation** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#starter-template]:
- Use T3 Stack as foundation which provides Next.js 14+, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Prisma, NextAuth.js, and tRPC
- Aligns with PRD requirements and provides solid foundation for rapid development

**Repository Structure** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#repository-structure]:
- **Structure:** Monorepo with Next.js fullstack application
- **Monorepo Tool:** Turborepo for build optimization and caching
- **Package Organization:** Apps (web), packages (shared types, UI components, utilities)

**Database Schema Context** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#database-schema]:
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- Core models: User, Board, Task, Column, BoardCollaborator
- Optimized relationships and performance indexes
- Uses cuid() for primary keys and proper cascade behavior

### Project Structure Requirements

**Basic Folder Structure** [Source: AC #8]:
```
project-root/
├── app/                 # Next.js App Router pages and layouts
├── components/          # Reusable React components
├── lib/                # Utility functions and configurations
├── prisma/             # Database schema and migrations
├── public/             # Static assets
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
└── docker-compose.yml  # Local development database
```

### Configuration Requirements

**TypeScript Configuration:**
- Strict mode enabled for type safety
- Path aliases configured for clean imports
- Next.js specific TypeScript settings

**ESLint and Prettier:**
- Consistent code formatting and linting rules
- Integration with Next.js and TypeScript
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality

**Docker Compose:**
- PostgreSQL 15+ container for local development
- Proper environment variable configuration
- Health checks and volume persistence
