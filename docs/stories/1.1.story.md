## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 14.1+ with App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.3+ with strict configuration
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui (latest) for accessible component system
- **CSS Framework:** TailwindCSS 3.4+ for utility-first styling
- **Database ORM:** Prisma 5.8+ for type-safe database access
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ for primary data storage
- **Package Manager:** pnpm 8.14+ for efficient dependency management
- **Build Tool:** Turborepo 1.11+ for monorepo build system
- **Testing:** Vitest 1.2+ with React Testing Library 14+
- **Code Quality:** ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting

**Starter Template Recommendation** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#starter-template]:
- Use T3 Stack as foundation which provides Next.js 14+, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Prisma, NextAuth.js, and tRPC
- Aligns with PRD requirements and provides solid foundation for rapid development

**Repository Structure** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#repository-structure]:
- **Structure:** Monorepo with Next.js fullstack application
- **Monorepo Tool:** Turborepo for build optimization and caching
- **Package Organization:** Apps (web), packages (shared types, UI components, utilities)

**Database Schema Context** [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#database-schema]:
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- Core models: User, Board, Task, Column, BoardCollaborator
- Optimized relationships and performance indexes
- Uses cuid() for primary keys and proper cascade behavior
