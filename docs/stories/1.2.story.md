## Story

As a developer,
I want a properly designed database schema with reliable connections,
so that user and application data can be stored and retrieved efficiently.

1. Prisma schema defined for User, Board, Column, and Task entities
2. Database migrations created and tested
3. Connection pooling configured for production scalability
4. Database seeding script created for development data
5. Environment variables properly configured for database connection
6. Database connection health check endpoint implemented
7. Error handling implemented for database connection failures

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md#completion-notes]
- Prisma 6.13.0 successfully installed and basic User model created
- Docker Compose PostgreSQL 15 container configured and functional
- Database connection utilities established in `src/lib/db.ts`
- Health check endpoint `/api/health` implemented with basic database connectivity test
- Environment variables configured for local development database connection

### Data Models
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#data-models]

**Core Entity Interfaces:**
- **User Model**: id (cuid), email (unique), name, avatar (optional), timestamps
- **Board Model**: id (cuid), name (varchar 100), description (text), ownerId, isPublic (boolean), timestamps
- **Column Model**: id (cuid), name, boardId, position (int), color (optional), timestamps  
- **Task Model**: id (cuid), title (varchar 200), description (text), columnId, boardId (denormalized), assigneeId (optional), priority (enum), dueDate (optional), position (int), timestamps
- **BoardCollaborator Model**: id (cuid), boardId, userId, role (enum), invitedAt, joinedAt (optional)

**Enums:**
- TaskPriority: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
- CollaboratorRole: VIEWER, EDITOR, ADMIN

### Database Schema Specifications
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#database-schema]

**Prisma Schema Requirements:**
- PostgreSQL database with optimized relationships and indexes
- Strategic indexing for performance: composite indexes for common query patterns
- Denormalized boardId in Task model for efficient board-level queries
- Cascade delete behavior: Board deletion cascades to columns and tasks
- SetNull behavior: User deletion sets assigneeId to null in tasks
- Performance indexes on: ownerId, updatedAt, isPublic, boardId, assigneeId, dueDate, priority
- Unique constraints: email (User), columnId+position (Task)

### Connection Pooling and Performance
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#performance-optimizations]
- Connection pooling configured for 100+ concurrent users
- Materialized views for pre-computed statistics and dashboard performance
- Strategic indexing for common query patterns
- Optimized for real-time collaboration workloads

### Environment Configuration
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#docker-compose]
- DATABASE_URL format: `postgresql://kanban_user:kanban_password@localhost:5432/kanban_db`
- Docker Compose PostgreSQL 15-alpine configuration
- Health check configuration with pg_isready
- Volume persistence for data retention

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Database migration testing with rollback verification
- Connection pooling stress testing
- Schema validation testing
- Seeding script verification
- Health check endpoint testing

## Project Structure Notes

The database implementation aligns with the established project structure:
- Schema definition: `prisma/schema.prisma` (existing, to be expanded)
- Database utilities: `src/lib/db.ts` (existing, to be enhanced)
- Seeding scripts: `prisma/seed.ts` (new)
- Migration files: `prisma/migrations/` (generated)
- Type definitions: `src/types/database.ts` (new)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified and tested
- [ ] Database schema matches architecture specifications exactly
- [ ] Migration and seeding processes documented and tested
- [ ] Connection pooling configured and performance tested

## Dev Agent Record

*This section will be populated by the Dev Agent during implementation*

### Implementation Notes
- Successfully expanded Prisma schema with all 5 core entities (User, Board, Column, Task, BoardCollaborator)
- Implemented strategic indexing for performance optimization with composite indexes
- Configured connection pooling for 100+ concurrent users with proper timeout settings
- Created comprehensive database seeding script with realistic test data
- Enhanced health check endpoint with detailed database monitoring and migration status
- Implemented robust error handling with retry logic and connection recovery mechanisms
- All database operations tested with 32 passing unit and integration tests

### Challenges Encountered
- **Port Conflict**: PostgreSQL port 5432 was already in use, resolved by changing to port 5433
- **Docker Container Conflicts**: Existing container name conflicts resolved by removing old containers
- **Prisma Metrics API**: $metrics API not available in all Prisma versions, implemented graceful fallback
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Required careful type definitions for database error handling and connection recovery
- **Environment Validation**: Implemented comprehensive environment variable validation with production safety checks

### Completion Notes
✅ **All 7 Acceptance Criteria Met:**
1. ✅ Prisma schema defined for all entities with proper relationships and constraints
2. ✅ Database migrations created and tested (initial_schema migration successful)
