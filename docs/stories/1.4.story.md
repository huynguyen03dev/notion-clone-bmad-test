# Story 1.4: Application Shell and Navigation

## Story Metadata
- **Epic:** Epic 1 - Foundation & Authentication
- **Story ID:** 1.4
- **Story Points:** 8
- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** InProgress
- **Assigned Agent:** James (Full Stack Developer)
- **Dependencies:** Story 1.3 (Authentication System Implementation)

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** a clean, responsive application layout with intuitive navigation,
**so that** I can easily access different parts of the application and have a consistent, professional experience across all devices.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Responsive Layout System**: Application shell adapts seamlessly to desktop (1200px+), tablet (768-1199px), and mobile (320-767px) viewports with appropriate navigation patterns for each breakpoint.

2. **Primary Navigation Structure**: Top navigation bar on desktop with logo, board switcher, global search, user menu, and real-time collaboration indicators; bottom tab bar on mobile with Dashboard, Current Board, Search, and Profile tabs.

3. **Dynamic Breadcrumb System**: Context-aware breadcrumbs showing current location (Dashboard > Board Name > Task Name when modal open) with clickable navigation back to parent levels.

4. **Theme System Implementation**: Light and dark theme support with system preference detection, manual toggle, and persistent user preference storage across sessions.

5. **Loading States and Transitions**: Skeleton screens for initial page loads, smooth transitions between routes, and loading indicators for async operations with consistent animation patterns.

6. **Keyboard Navigation Support**: Full keyboard accessibility with tab order, focus indicators, skip links, and keyboard shortcuts (accessible via '?' key for help overlay).

7. **Real-time Collaboration Indicators**: User presence indicators in navigation showing active collaborators with avatars, online status, and current board context.

8. **Progressive Web App Shell**: Service worker implementation for offline functionality, app-like experience on mobile devices, and fast loading with proper caching strategies.

**Previous Story Insights:**
- Authentication system is fully implemented with NextAuth.js
- User session management is available via `useSession()` hook
- Protected routes are handled by middleware in `src/middleware.ts`
- Route groups in Next.js don't create URL segments (learned from auth implementation)
- TypeScript type definitions are established in `src/types/auth.ts`

**Database Integration:**
- User model includes `id`, `name`, `email`, `avatar` fields for navigation display
- Board model will be needed for board switcher functionality
- Real-time collaboration will use WebSocket connections (Socket.IO)

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: 320px - 767px (bottom tab navigation)
- Tablet: 768px - 1199px (condensed top navigation)
- Desktop: 1200px+ (full top navigation with all features)

### Testing Standards
