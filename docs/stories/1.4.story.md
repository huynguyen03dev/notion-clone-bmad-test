# Story 1.4: Application Shell and Navigation

## Story Metadata
- **Epic:** Epic 1 - Foundation & Authentication
- **Story ID:** 1.4
- **Story Points:** 8
- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** InProgress
- **Assigned Agent:** James (Full Stack Developer)
- **Dependencies:** Story 1.3 (Authentication System Implementation)

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** a clean, responsive application layout with intuitive navigation,
**so that** I can easily access different parts of the application and have a consistent, professional experience across all devices.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Responsive Layout System**: Application shell adapts seamlessly to desktop (1200px+), tablet (768-1199px), and mobile (320-767px) viewports with appropriate navigation patterns for each breakpoint.

2. **Primary Navigation Structure**: Top navigation bar on desktop with logo, board switcher, global search, user menu, and real-time collaboration indicators; bottom tab bar on mobile with Dashboard, Current Board, Search, and Profile tabs.

3. **Dynamic Breadcrumb System**: Context-aware breadcrumbs showing current location (Dashboard > Board Name > Task Name when modal open) with clickable navigation back to parent levels.

4. **Theme System Implementation**: Light and dark theme support with system preference detection, manual toggle, and persistent user preference storage across sessions.

5. **Loading States and Transitions**: Skeleton screens for initial page loads, smooth transitions between routes, and loading indicators for async operations with consistent animation patterns.

6. **Keyboard Navigation Support**: Full keyboard accessibility with tab order, focus indicators, skip links, and keyboard shortcuts (accessible via '?' key for help overlay).

7. **Real-time Collaboration Indicators**: User presence indicators in navigation showing active collaborators with avatars, online status, and current board context.

8. **Progressive Web App Shell**: Service worker implementation for offline functionality, app-like experience on mobile devices, and fast loading with proper caching strategies.

**Previous Story Insights:**
- Authentication system is fully implemented with NextAuth.js
- User session management is available via `useSession()` hook
- Protected routes are handled by middleware in `src/middleware.ts`
- Route groups in Next.js don't create URL segments (learned from auth implementation)
- TypeScript type definitions are established in `src/types/auth.ts`

**Database Integration:**
- User model includes `id`, `name`, `email`, `avatar` fields for navigation display
- Board model will be needed for board switcher functionality
- Real-time collaboration will use WebSocket connections (Socket.IO)

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: 320px - 767px (bottom tab navigation)
- Tablet: 768px - 1199px (condensed top navigation)
- Desktop: 1200px+ (full top navigation with all features)

### Testing Standards

**Test File Locations:**
- Component tests: `src/components/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `src/__tests__/integration/`
- E2E tests: `e2e/navigation/`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- **Unit/Component:** Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Integration:** Vitest + Supertest for API testing
- **E2E:** Playwright for cross-browser testing
- **Accessibility:** @axe-core/react for a11y testing

**Testing Requirements:**
- All navigation components must have unit tests
- Responsive behavior testing across breakpoints
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility testing
- Theme switching functionality testing
- Real-time collaboration indicator testing
- PWA functionality testing

**Performance Standards:**
- Navigation animations must maintain 60fps
- Route transitions should complete within 300ms
- Initial navigation render should be under 100ms
- Theme switching should be instantaneous

### Completion Notes List

#### 2025-01-03 - James (Full Stack Developer)

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ **Task 1: Responsive Layout Foundation** - Implemented complete application shell with responsive design
- ✅ **Task 2: Navigation Components** - Built all navigation components with proper routing integration
- ✅ **Task 3: Theme System** - Complete light/dark theme system with persistence and system detection
- ✅ **Task 4: Loading States and Animations** - Complete animation system with transitions, loading indicators, and performance optimization

**Key Implementation Details:**

**Application Shell (`src/components/layout/app-shell.tsx`):**
- Route-based layout switching (auth routes vs protected routes vs public routes)
- Responsive navigation switching (desktop top nav vs mobile bottom nav)
- Integration with authentication system and session management
- Loading states during session verification

**Desktop Navigation (`src/components/layout/navigation/desktop-nav.tsx`):**
- Top navigation bar with logo, board switcher, global search, and user menu
- Responsive breakpoint handling (hidden on mobile, full features on desktop)
- Dynamic breadcrumb integration for authenticated routes
- Theme toggle and action buttons (create, notifications)

**Mobile Navigation (`src/components/layout/navigation/mobile-nav.tsx`):**
- Bottom tab bar with essential navigation (Dashboard, Boards, Search, Profile)
- Touch-friendly design with proper spacing and icons
- Active state indication with visual feedback
- Hidden for unauthenticated users

**Board Switcher (`src/components/layout/navigation/board-switcher.tsx`):**
- Dropdown component with search functionality
- Mock data structure ready for API integration
- Recent boards display with last modified timestamps
- Create new board action integration

**Breadcrumbs (`src/components/layout/navigation/breadcrumbs.tsx`):**
- Dynamic breadcrumb generation based on current route
- Context-aware navigation (Dashboard > Board > Task when applicable)
- Clickable navigation back to parent levels
- Proper accessibility with semantic HTML

**Theme System:**
- `ThemeProvider` with React Context for global theme state
- Light/dark/system theme options with automatic system detection
- Persistent storage in localStorage with SSR-safe implementation
- `ThemeToggle` component with smooth transitions and proper icons

**Testing Implementation:**
- Comprehensive navigation component tests (7/7 passing)
- Theme system tests (5/6 passing - one edge case to refine)
- Mock setup for `window.matchMedia` in test environment
- Test coverage for responsive behavior and authentication states

**Dependencies Added:**
- `framer-motion` for future animations
- `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu` for accessible dropdowns
- `@radix-ui/react-navigation-menu` for navigation primitives
- `@radix-ui/react-dialog` for modal functionality
- `@radix-ui/react-separator` for visual separators

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used Radix UI primitives for accessibility and consistency
- Implemented mobile-first responsive design approach
- Separated concerns with dedicated components for each navigation type
- Integrated with existing authentication system from Story 1.3
- Used TailwindCSS for consistent styling and responsive breakpoints

**Task 4 Completion - Animation System:**

**Animation Infrastructure (`src/components/layout/animations/`):**
- `PageTransition` component with smooth route transitions using Framer Motion
- `LoadingSpinner` with configurable sizes and text support
- `PulseLoader` for subtle animated loading states
- `ProgressLoader` with animated progress bars and percentage display
- `LoadingButton` with integrated loading states and disabled handling

**Animation Utilities:**
- Comprehensive animation variants (fadeInUp, slideInFromBottom, scaleIn, etc.)
- Reusable transition configurations (spring, ease, fast)
- Stagger animations for list items with proper timing
- Hover animations (scale, lift effects) for interactive elements
- `AnimatedContainer` and `StaggeredList` wrapper components

**Performance Optimizations:**
- `PerformanceConfig` wrapper with reduced motion support
- Optimized animation presets targeting 60fps performance
- CSS-based animations for simple transitions
- Performance monitoring hooks for development debugging
- Transform-based animations over layout animations for better performance

**Integration Updates:**
- Updated `AppShell` with `PageTransition` wrapper for route animations
- Enhanced `MobileNav` with staggered item animations and active tab indicators
- Improved `BoardSwitcher` with rotation animations for dropdown chevron
- Added loading states to authentication flow and session management

**Current Status:**
