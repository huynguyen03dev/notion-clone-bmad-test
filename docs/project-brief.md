# Project Brief: Kanban Board Application

## Executive Summary

A modern, web-based kanban board application that enables teams and individuals to visualize workflow, manage tasks, and track project progress through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. The application addresses the need for a clean, performant, and customizable project management tool that combines the simplicity of traditional kanban boards with modern web application capabilities. Built with Next.js 14+ App Router, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui components, targeting teams seeking an efficient alternative to heavyweight project management solutions.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** Teams and individuals struggle with project management tools that are either too complex (enterprise solutions with overwhelming features) or too basic (simple to-do lists without workflow visualization). Existing solutions often suffer from:
- Poor performance and slow loading times
- Cluttered interfaces that hinder productivity
- Limited customization options
- High subscription costs for basic kanban functionality
- Lack of real-time collaboration features

**Impact:** This leads to decreased productivity, poor project visibility, and teams reverting to inefficient methods like spreadsheets or sticky notes. The absence of a middle-ground solution costs teams valuable time in task management overhead.

**Why Now:** The rise of remote and hybrid work has increased demand for visual project management tools. Modern web technologies now enable building fast, responsive applications that can compete with desktop alternatives while being accessible from anywhere.

## Proposed Solution

A lightweight, fast-loading kanban board application that focuses on core workflow visualization without feature bloat. The solution will:

**Core Concept:** Provide an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for managing tasks across customizable columns (To Do, In Progress, Done, etc.) with real-time updates and clean visual design.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Lightning-fast performance through Next.js App Router and optimized rendering
- Beautiful, accessible UI using shadcn/ui components and TailwindCSS
- Docker-based deployment for easy self-hosting
- Focus on essential features without overwhelming complexity
- Responsive design that works seamlessly across devices

**Success Factors:** By prioritizing performance, user experience, and simplicity, this solution will succeed where others become bloated by staying focused on the core kanban workflow.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Small Development Teams (3-10 members)
**Profile:** Software development teams, design agencies, and digital marketing teams working on multiple concurrent projects.
**Current Behaviors:** Using a mix of GitHub Issues, Trello, or Notion for project tracking, often switching between tools.
**Pain Points:** Need better integration with development workflow, faster performance, and cleaner interfaces.
**Goals:** Streamline project visibility, improve team coordination, and reduce context switching between tools.

### Secondary User Segment: Individual Professionals & Freelancers
**Profile:** Freelancers, consultants, and individual contributors managing multiple client projects or personal tasks.
**Current Behaviors:** Using basic to-do apps, spreadsheets, or paper-based systems.
**Pain Points:** Lack of visual project overview and difficulty prioritizing across multiple projects.
**Goals:** Better project organization, client communication, and professional presentation of work status.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
- Launch MVP within 8-12 weeks with core kanban functionality
- Achieve sub-2 second initial page load times
- Support 100+ concurrent users without performance degradation
- Maintain 95%+ uptime for hosted instances

### User Success Metrics
- Users create their first board within 2 minutes of signup
- Average session duration of 15+ minutes indicating engagement
- 80%+ of users return within 7 days of first use
- Task completion rate increases by 25% compared to previous tools

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Page Load Speed**: <2 seconds initial load, <500ms navigation
- **User Adoption**: 70% of new users create at least 3 tasks in first session
- **Retention**: 60% weekly active user retention after 4 weeks
- **Performance**: Support 1000+ tasks per board without UI lag

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
- **Board Creation & Management:** Create, rename, and delete kanban boards with customizable column names
- **Task Management:** Add, edit, delete, and move tasks between columns with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Real-time Updates:** Live synchronization of changes across multiple users viewing the same board
- **Responsive Design:** Fully functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Data Persistence:** PostgreSQL backend with reliable data storage and retrieval
- **Basic User Management:** Simple authentication and user accounts

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Advanced user roles and permissions
- File attachments and rich text editing
- Time tracking and reporting features
- Integration with external tools (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Bulk operations and automation rules

### MVP Success Criteria
The MVP is successful when a team of 5 users can effectively manage a project with 50+ tasks across multiple columns, with all changes syncing in real-time and the application remaining responsive throughout typical usage patterns.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features
- User roles and board permissions (admin, editor, viewer)
- Task assignments and due dates
- Basic filtering and search functionality
- Board templates for common workflows
- Simple reporting and analytics dashboard

### Long-term Vision
Evolve into a comprehensive but lightweight project management platform that maintains its core simplicity while adding thoughtful features based on user feedback. Potential for team collaboration features, API access, and integration ecosystem.

### Expansion Opportunities
- Mobile native applications
- Advanced automation and workflow rules
- Integration marketplace with popular development tools
- White-label solutions for agencies
- Enterprise features for larger organizations

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements
- **Target Platforms:** Web application (primary), Progressive Web App capabilities
- **Browser/OS Support:** Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- **Performance Requirements:** <2s initial load, <500ms interactions, 60fps animations

### Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+ with App Router, React 18+, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes or separate FastAPI service
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM or similar
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Docker Compose for development, containerized deployment

### Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with clear separation of concerns
- **Service Architecture:** Full-stack Next.js application with API routes
- **Integration Requirements:** RESTful API design for future mobile apps
- **Security/Compliance:** JWT authentication, input validation, SQL injection prevention

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget:** Self-funded development project with minimal external costs
- **Timeline:** 8-12 week development window for MVP
- **Resources:** Single developer initially, potential for additional contributors
- **Technical:** Must be deployable via Docker Compose for easy self-hosting

### Key Assumptions
- Users prefer simplicity over feature richness for kanban boards
- Real-time collaboration is essential for team adoption
- Modern web technologies can deliver desktop-app-like performance
- Self-hosting capability will differentiate from SaaS-only competitors
- Teams will migrate from existing tools if performance and UX are superior

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **Performance at Scale:** Real-time updates may impact performance with large boards or many concurrent users
- **User Adoption:** Market saturation with existing kanban tools may limit adoption
- **Technical Complexity:** Real-time features may introduce development complexity beyond timeline

### Open Questions
- What is the optimal number of tasks per board before performance degrades?
- Should we support offline functionality for mobile users?
- How important is data export/import for user migration?
- What level of customization do users expect for board appearance?

### Areas Needing Further Research
- Competitive analysis of existing kanban tools and their limitations
- User interviews with target segments to validate assumptions
- Technical feasibility testing for real-time collaboration features
- Performance benchmarking requirements for different user scales

## Next Steps
